        This document details the design components of the Enteral Feeding Calculator project. The purpose of this project is to increase efficiency and effectiveness among nurses during the tube feeding process. The document covers product importance, usage, stakeholders, and views. Our solution will be an application designed for either mobile device or computer interfaces with potential methods specified below.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{User Interface Framework}
\subsubsection{Approach}
The uncertainty of a platform requires that the user interface framework is multi-platform.
Assuming a multi-platform or desktop implementation, Qt, supports a variety of platforms with similar or identical interfaces with the underlying programming language.
The layout and bindings to underlying data will be written using Qt's provided API, and the required libraries will be packaged with the software as allowed by the license for distribution. 
\subsubsection{Concerns}
Users will have a standard interface across platforms, both desktop and mobile, with due considerations made to the different input methods on desktop and mobile.
Software developers will need to develop interface methods that work on differing platforms instead of a single platform that choosing either desktop or mobile would allow, creating additional maintenance cost.
User interface designers accommodating multiple screen resolutions and ratios may produce an interface that is optimized for neither interface.
\subsection{Application Logic}
\subsubsection{Approach}
The math driving the calculations is only required to be called on user input events and does not change dynamically throughout the course of its use.
The language used for the application varies on the platform used for the project.
Javascript would be used for a web-based platform, Java would be used for a mobile-based platform, and Python would be used for a desktop-based platform.
The calculation function will only be called when valid inputs are received, and the form of the functions will take a data-driven approach.
Many languages implement features which allow for an optimized and easy-to-read data-driven implementation of functionality.

\subsubsection{Concerns}

\subsection{Interface Framework Integration}
\subsubsection{Approach}
Bound variables from Qt will be read by the underlying code.
These inputs will be checked for validity and converted into their proper data types.
Once converted into the types required for the application logic's calculations, the volumetric rate output is calculated and returned to the user.
The interface between the framework and the application logic will be performed using the Model-view-viewmodel design pattern.
\subsubsection{Concerns}
Software developers on open source projects focus their efforts highly on projects where they have the requisite skill.
Model-view-viewmodel is a common design pattern for UI integration in desktop and mobile applications. 
User Interface designers that wish to improve the design will find familiarity with web design frameworks, such as Vue.js, which uses a model-view-viewmodel method to interface between client and server.
Users will experience a lower performance impact, as the application will remain static when not in use.
